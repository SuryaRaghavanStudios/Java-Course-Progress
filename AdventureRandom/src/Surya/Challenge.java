    /*
    PART 1:
        Modify the program so that it uses a BufferedReader to read in the
        locations data.

        Run the program to test it before moving on to Part 2.

    PART 2:
        Modify the main method of the Locations class so that it uses a
        BufferedWriter to write the data.

        Open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the
        data has been written successfully.

        You will then need to make another change to the program to allow
        for the 0 (Quit) exits before using the newly created files.

        HINT: You may want to change the three instances of HashMap to
            LinkedHashMap in the Location class and one instance in the
            Locations class so that you can compare the files more easily.
